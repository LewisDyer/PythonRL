# PythonRL
An (initially!) small project to make a roguelike in Python3 using libtcod.

To begin with, I'm following the [Roguelike Tutorials tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1) fairly closely.
My initial plan is to go through that, then keep this project around and copy/adapt it to toy around with some ideas.
